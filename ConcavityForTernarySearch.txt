Slope: Slope like this ' / ' (bent forward) is positive. This ' \ ' (bent backward) is negative.

Inflation Point : Concavity changes at this point i.e., from concave upwards to concave downwards or vice versa

Concavity: Two Types Concave Function :- (Video 2)

             1. Concave Downward (Concave) function : Slope in this type of graph first gradually becomes less positive, then it becomes zero and then gradually
                becomes negative [This graph increases first, then reaches maximum and then decreases].
                Note : local max. point can be found using ternary search, if we have Concave downward function.
                Let f(x) be concave downward function. Then from above defination, we know slope of this function will be decreasing (positive to negative) i.e.,
                f'(x) (1st derivative) will be decreasing => f''(x)<0
                Note: if f'(a)=0 then 'a' is max.(local) point

             2. Concave Upward (Convex) function : Slope in this type of graph first gradually becomes less negative, then it becomes zero and then gradually
                becomes positive [This graph is decreases first, then reaches minimum and then increases].
                Note: local min, point can be found using ternary serch, if we have Concave Upward function.
                Let f(x) be concave upward function. Then from above defination, we know slope of this function will be increasing (negative to positive) i.e.,
                f'(x) will be increasing => f''(x)>0
                Note: of f'(a)=0 then 'a' is min.(local) point

Q. What if f''(x)=0 at some point/s ?
   Let 'a' be some point on any concave function and f''(a)=0 then inflation point exist (i.e., concavity changes if we go from left of 'a' to its right)
   and 'a' is x-coordinate of that inflation point.
   Inflation Point : (a,f(a))

Q. What if f''(x) is undefined at some point/s ?
   Let 'a' be some point on any concave function and f''(a)=undefined then there cannot exist any inflation point
   Note : concavity still changes if we go from left of 'a' to its right

eg: Let f(x) = 1/(x+1) 
        f'(x) = -1/(x+1)^2
        f''(x) = 2/(x+1)^3
        Now, notice at point x=-1 in f''(x), the function is undefined i.e., no inflation point exist
        Putting any value a>-1 we can see f''(x)>0 i.e., f'(x) is increasing i.e., f(x) have shape of concave upward graph for x>0 
        Putting any value a<-1 we can see f''(x)<0 i.e., f'(x) is decreasing i.e., f(x) have shape of concave downward graph for x<0

eg: Let f(x) = x^3 + 2
        f'(x) = 3x^2 
        f''(x) = 6x
        Notice at point x=0, f''(x=0)=0 i.e., inflation point exist.
        Inflation Point =(0,f(0))=(0,2)
        Putting any value a>0 we can see f''(x)>0 i.e., f'(x) is increasing i.e., f(x) have shape of concave upward graph for x>0
        Putting any value a<0 we can see f''(x)<0 i.e., f'(x) is decreasing i.e., f(x) have shape of concave downward graph for x<0

eg: https://codeforces.com/contest/1288/problem/A (Codeforces: DeadLine)
    In this, we need to find x such that  x + ceil(d/(x+1)) <= n , if possible

    Let f(x) = x + ceil(d/(x+1)) = x + (d+x)/(x+1) = x + (d-1)/(x+1) + 1 
    f'(x) = 1 - (d-1)/(x+1)^2
    f''(x) = 2(d-1)/(x+1)^3
    Putting x=-1 , f''(x)=undefined. Therefore no inflation point exist.
    for x<-1 , f''(x) <0 i.e., f'(x) is decreasing i.e., f(x) have shape of concave downward graph for x<-1
    for x>-1 , f''(x) >0 i.e., f'(x) is increasing i.e., f(x) have shape of concave upward graph for x>-1
    
    In our problem, it is given that x must be non-negative integer i.e., for us , f(x) is concave upward function and is increasing. Therefore, we
    can find min. point in f(x) using ternary search.
